# Learn programming

##### Overview

Although the Internet is full of websites where you can learn to program, there are often too many and on most you will not find what you are looking for.
It can easily happen that you suddenly find yourself on a website that doesn't explain the topic correctly or even incorrectly.
This is exactly what our website should prevent.
On our site you will not only find a course where the course topic is explained, you will also find links to videos, other websites where the topic gets explaint and other useful things.
As a web-application, we have two things in mind.
Either a form where you can ask and answer questions or a page where you can create your own course to teach someone else your knowledge
However, the web application is not yet 100% certain.
Our project should be ready before the end of this school year, to present it.
We are currently working on the following official courses

-	C# (in progress)
-	C
-	Html
-	Css
-	Unity (in progress)
-	Scratch

At the moment only two people are working on the project, Wolfmayr Clemens and Neum√ºller Jakob.




## Project Summary

The reason for this idea is to simplify learning but also to be an easy way to summarize the best websites for the topic you are looking for.
As already mentioned, in course there will be our own explaining but also links to other websites and videos.
Our site is written with html and css but we will also use bootstrap, javascript and possibly a json server, to store the data.
We want to finish our project several months before the end of this school year so that we can make improvements before we have to present and hand it over.
The expected costs are zero euros because we have to make it for school.





## Project Methodology

In order to coordinate the website, we have carefully selected who will do what.
Who the main page, who will make which course and what on the web-application.
We use github, onedrive and whatsapp to exchange data and we always back up our project at the end of the week. 

First the main page will be completed, but only as far as it is necessary to be able to manage all pages (for example the design will only be completed at the end when the design for the course has been determined).
Then the course should be completed. 
This takes about three weeks for the 6 courses since everyone does two and we plan about a week for each course so that everything fits.
However, a person will already dedicate himself to the web application so that it works, if there are delusions.

## Issues:
The following points are necessary to complete the project

-	First the main page will be completed (the design will be completed at the end)
-	Next, all six courses will be finished 
-	Then the web-application is made
-	After the completion of all courses, we will make a page were you can see all courses (optional: you can also search for them, if we have enough time)
-	At the end we will finish the design an make some other pages like a impressum

## Additional:
Our target group is primarily pupil but also people who want to learn something.
The remaining points are left out because no money is invested and no costs are incurred.
Likewise, there is only the risk that we will not finish it in time and get a bad mark.
